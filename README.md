# Android USB OTG serial proof of concept

A simple Android application to receive serial data (_e.g.,_ from an Arduino) over USB OTB.

I had initially thought of _Solution1_: to use Bluetooth. Trying to reduce cost and eliminate components
I'd arrived at _Solution 2_: serial over USB OTG.

## Solution 2



## Solution  3/4

Need to find hardware to get from CAN to UART/GPIO.
